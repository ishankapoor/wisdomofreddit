    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">
      Real people spend a lot of time writing high quality, insightful comments on reddit. Once interest in the thread dies down, the comments are effectively dead. They don't really show up in Google searches. What a waste! Wisdom of reddit would like to save these quality comments and help you search for them.
